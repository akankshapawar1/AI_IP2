I have mostly referred to the code from search.py from AIMA-python.
Additionally, I referred some blogs from Geeksforgeeks to understand some concepts.

Here are some of the design decisions I made in my code -
1. I have used priority queue instead of memoize to keep track of sorting of heuristic values.
2. I have created a dictionary to remember the order of cities that was taken to reach the goal city.
    In the end, I am traversing the dictionary to print the path.
3. I also used same constants for "exp_schedule" and "probability" from aima-python.
4. I reused code for graph class from search.py.
5. I implemented functions from utils in SPSA class so I did not add util.py in the project.

Thank you!
